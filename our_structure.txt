 fm,k is the characteristic bending strength
 γM is the partial safety factor for material properties
2.1.3
Load Analysis
According to Eurocode (EN 1990, EN 1991), we must consider all relevant actions on the

Dead Loads (G)
The permanent actions include:

According to EN 1991-1-3 (Eurocode 1: Actions on structures - Part 1-3:
General actions - Snow loads), the characteristic snow load on the roof is calculated using the
following formula:
s = µ1 × Ce × Ct × sk
[kN/m²]
(4)
where:
 s is the snow load on the roof [kN/m²]
 µ1 is the roof shape coecient, determined by roof pitch angle:
 For α = 16°: µ1 = 0.8 (linear interpolation between 0.8 for α ≤30° and 0.0 for
α ≥60°)
 Ce is the exposure coecient:

 Ce = 1.0 for normal topography (no signicant removal of snow by wind)
 Ct is the thermal coecient:
 Ct = 1.0 for normal thermal insulation (< 1.0 only for glazed roofs)
 sk = 0.7 kN/m² is the characteristic ground snow load for Warsaw region (Zone 2)
Step-by-step calculation:
1. Determine µ1 based on roof angle:
 α = 16° →µ1 = 0.8
2. Verify exposure conditions:
 Normal topography →Ce = 1.0
3. Check thermal conditions:
 Standard roof insulation →Ct = 1.0
4. Look up ground snow load:
 Warsaw (Zone 2) →sk = 0.7 kN/m²
5. Calculate roof snow load:
s = 0.8 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.7 = 0.56 kN/m²
(5)
Wind Load (W)
According to EN 1991-1-4 (Eurocode 1: Actions on structures - Part 1-4:
General actions - Wind actions), the peak velocity pressure is calculated through a series of
steps:
1. Basic Wind Velocity
The basic wind velocity is dened as:
vb = cdir × cseason × vb,0
[m/s]
(6)
where:
 vb is the basic wind velocity [m/s]
 cdir = 1.0 is the directional factor (recommended value)
 cseason = 1.0 is the season factor (recommended value)
 vb,0 = 22 m/s is the fundamental basic wind velocity for Warsaw region
2. Mean Wind Velocity
The mean wind velocity at height z is calculated as:
vm(z) = cr(z) × co(z) × vb
[m/s]
(7)
where:
 cr(z) is the roughness factor
 co(z) = 1.0 is the orography factor (for at terrain)
 For terrain category III (suburban area):
 z0 = 0.3 m (roughness length)
 zmin = 5 m (minimum height)

3. Peak Velocity Pressure
The peak velocity pressure at height z is given by:
qp(z) = ce(z) × qb = ce(z) × 1
2ρv2
b
[kN/m²]
(8)
where:
 qp(z) is the peak velocity pressure [kN/m²]
 ce(z) = 1.6 is the exposure factor at height z = 2.65m
 ρ = 1.25 kg/m³ is the air density
 qb is the basic velocity pressure [kN/m²]
Step-by-step calculation:
1. Calculate basic wind velocity:
vb = 1.0 × 1.0 × 22 = 22 m/s
(9)
2. Calculate basic velocity pressure:
qb = 1
2 × 1.25 × 222 = 0.302 kN/m²
(10)
3. Determine exposure factor:
 For z = 2.65m, terrain category III: ce(z) = 1.6
4. Calculate peak velocity pressure:
qp(z) = 1.6 × 0.302 = 0.483 kN/m²
(11)
This peak velocity pressure is used for determining the wind forces on the building structure,
considering pressure coecients for dierent building surfaces.
2.1.4
Ultimate Limit State Analysis
According to EN 1990, we analyze two load combinations to determine the critical design load:
Load Combinations
Ed1 = 1.35G + 1.5S + 1.5ψ0W
Ed2 = 1.35G + 1.5W + 1.5ψ0S
(12)
where:
 G = 0.25 kN/m² (total dead load)
 S = 0.56 kN/m² (snow load)
 W = 0.483 kN/m² (wind load)
 ψ0 = 0.6 (combination factor)
Resulting in:
Ed1 = 1.35(0.25) + 1.5(0.56) + 1.5(0.6)(0.483) = 1.401 kN/m²
Ed2 = 1.35(0.25) + 1.5(0.483) + 1.5(0.5)(0.56) = 1.337 kN/m²
(13)
Design load: Ed = max(Ed1, Ed2) = 1.401 kN/m²

Conclusion
All structural elements and thermal assemblies meet the required performance criteria according
to relevant Eurocode standards:
 All ULS verications passed with adequate safety margins
 Cross-section properties ensure ecient load distribution
 Thermal performance exceeds minimum requirements for both wall and roof assemblies
 All connections and details follow standard specications
